# Installation

### Update Depencies
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

```
sudo apt install ufw -y
```

### Setup Firewall
```
ufw allow ssh
ufw allow https
ufw allow http
ufw allow 9151
ufw enable
```


### Install docker
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

```
# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

```
sudo docker run hello-world
```



### Setup Password Variable
```
export NULINK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<YOUR NULINK STORAGE PASSWORD>
export NULINK_OPERATOR_ETH_PASSWORD=<YOUR WORKER ACCOUNT PASSWORD>
```
Change both to the password you preffered

### Create Worker Account
Download GETH and Extract
```
wget https://gethstore.blob.core.windows.net/builds/geth-linux-amd64-1.10.23-d901d853.tar.gz && tar -xvzf geth-linux-amd64-1.10.23-d901d853.tar.gz
```
Rename the directory
```
mv geth-linux-amd64-1.10.23-d901d853 geth
```
Go to the geth dir
```
cd geth/
```
Now Create the worker account key by running the command below inside the dir geth
```
./geth account new --keystore ./keystore
```
You will be prompted to enter the password and confirm the password. Please remember this password for late use.
Example:
```
INFO [09-08|15:30:11.904] Maximum peer count                       ETH=50 LES=0 total=50
INFO [09-08|15:30:11.905] Smartcard socket not found, disabling    err="stat /run/pcscd/pcscd.comm: no such file or directory"
Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
Password: 
Repeat password: 

Your new key was generated


Public address of the key:   0x8B1819341BEc211a45a2186C4D0030681cccE0Ee
Path of the secret key file: /root/geth-linux-amd64-1.10.23-d901d853/keystore/UTC--2022-09-13T01-14-32.465358210Z--8b1819341bec211a45a2186c4d0030681ccce0ee

- You can share your public address with anyone. Others need it to interact with you.
- You must NEVER share the secret key with anyone! The key controls access to your funds!
- You must BACKUP your key file! Without the key, it's impossible to access account funds!
- You must REMEMBER your password! Without the password, it's impossible to decrypt the key!
```
### Create Nulink Directory
```
cd $HOME
sudo mkdir nulink
```
Copy the keystore file of the Worker account to the host directory. The private file generated by NuLink Worker will also be stored in this directory.
```
cp $HOME/geth/keystore/* $HOME/nulink
```
Give the directory 777 Permission
```
sudo chmod -R 777 $HOME/nulink
```
### Init Worker
```
docker run -it --rm \
-p 9151:9151 \
-v /root/nulink:/code \
-v /root/nulink:/home/circleci/.local/share/nulink \
-e NULINK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
nulink/nulink nulink ursula init \
--signer keystore:///code/UTC--2024-01-03T13-01-28.368005063Z--2feea2c1fdb5834137a79201c3f624e5bafe1e77 \
--eth-provider https://data-seed-prebsc-2-s2.binance.org:8545 \
--network horus \
--payment-provider https://data-seed-prebsc-2-s2.binance.org:8545 \
--payment-network bsc_testnet \
--operator-address  0x2fEea2c1fdB5834137a79201c3f624e5baFE1E77 \
--max-gas-price 10000000000
```
Change the --signer and --operator-address to your own!
Example Output :
```
# step 1
 Detected IPv4 address (8.219.186.xxx) - Is this the public-facing address of Ursula? [y/N]: y
 
 Please provide a password to lock Operator keys.
 Do not forget this password, and ideally store it using a password manager.
 
 # step 2
 Enter nulink keystore password (8 character minimum): xxxxxx
 Repeat for confirmation: xxxxxx
 
 Backup your seed words, you will not be able to view them again.
 
 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 
 # step 3
 Have you backed up your seed phrase? [y/N]: y
 
 # step 4
 Confirm seed words: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 
 
Public Key:   02bb2067d21a677ce928967c0ece79a9
Path to Keystore: /home/circleci/.local/share/nulink/keystore

- You can share your public key with anyone. Others need it to interact with you.
- Never share secret keys with anyone! 
- Backup your keystore! Character keys are required to interact with the protocol!
- Remember your password! Without the password, it's impossible to decrypt the key!


Generated configuration file at default filepath /home/circleci/.local/share/nulink/ursula.json

* Review configuration  -> nulink ursula config
* Start working         -> nulink ursula run
```
Dont forget to backup your Seed!

### Run the worker
Before running the worker make sure you have tBNB,you can get tBNB in here(https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet)

### Run Worker
```
docker run --restart on-failure -d \
--name ursula \
-p 9151:9151 \
-v $HOME/nulink:/code \
-v $HOME/nulink:/home/circleci/.local/share/nulink \
-e NULINK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
-e NULINK_OPERATOR_ETH_PASSWORD \
nulink/nulink nulink ursula run --no-block-until-ready
```
And your worker is now running
To check the logs you can type
```
docker logs -f ursula
```
Example output:
```

```

# Bond Worker
To bond your worker node to your staking account you can simply got to the Staking Dashboard (https://dashboard.testnet.nulink.org/)
remember to use different wallet, dont use your worker wallet!

### Stake NLK
Request tNLK and tBNB on the top side

- After receiving your tNLK and tBNB go to the Staking Page
And stake some NLK (Minimuum stake of 1 NLK) and Approve transaction.

- If its first time you will be asked to approve token spent first.

- Then Stake your tNLK

- Bond Worker
- Scroll down and you will see Node Information

- Click Bond worker and put your Operator Address that is generated in the Create Worker Account Step and approve transaction.
- Wait a few minutes and refresh the page.

- finish!
